# My Very First Web Page

## What it is
A website with three webpages showing various company logos. <br>
Each logo has a link attached to direct the user to a wiki page of the logos company.

## Technologies used
* I used **html5** to create the structure of the webpages
* I used **css3** to change the apperence and layout of my website
  * Changing the background colour to grey
  * Centering the text
  * Making the logos in-line
* I used **Cloud9** to create a workspace where i could create, edit and preveiw my code
* I used **GitHub** as a place to backup and share my code

## Summary
I enjoyed this project and felt it has helped me understand the basics of coding with *html* and *css*. <br>
I liked the purpose of the website, I think having a page showing the key technology
logos and relative links to wiki pages is a good idea and will come in handy for future referencing.
